# Factory Pattern Exercise

Create a simple logger system using the Factory pattern.

## Requirements

1. Create a `LoggerFactory` that can create different types of loggers
2. Implement 2 logger types:
  - ConsoleLogger (logs to console)
  - FileLogger (simulates file logging)
3. Each logger should have a `log` method

## Success Criteria

- Both logger types work with the same interface
- Factory creates the correct type based on input
- Each logger formats messages differently
