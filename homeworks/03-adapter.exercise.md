# Adapter Pattern Exercise

Create a simple math operations adapter that makes different calculation interfaces work together.

## Requirements

1. Create a MathOperations class with an `add(a, b)` method
2. Create a Calculator interface with a `calculate(a, b)` method
3. Create an adapter to make MathOperations work with the Calculator interface
4. Show both interfaces working together through the adapter

## Success Criteria
- Original MathOperations class remains unchanged
- Calculator interface is used through adapter
- Adapter successfully connects both parts
- Demonstrate the adapter in use
